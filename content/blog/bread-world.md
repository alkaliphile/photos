Hello bread. Hello birds. I'm Chris - a software developer currently living in Delaware, and those two things practically consitute my world these days. There at the top is a picture of the best looking loaf of sourdough I've ever baked. There's an images section, too, with the best bird photographs I've ever taken (if you ask me, anyway).

<br>

I've been needing to claim a home for myself here on the internet for a while, so after much work, tinkering with colors and code, and binging TV in the background (countless, countless hours of TV), here it is!

<br>

I'll be posting more bird pictures of mine that I think are decent, rambling about random aspects of photography, and eventually adding a section dedicated to my conservation goals. Plus there'll be talk about bread and maybe bodyweight fitness, too! We'll see.

<br>

Usually printing hello world doesn't take so many characters, but that's just how things are going to be around here.

<br>

Enjoy!
