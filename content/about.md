Hi! I'm Chris Keele, a software engineer living in Wilmington, Delaware.

<br>

I got serious about bird photography a few months into the pandemic. Before that,I had taken the occasional bird picture while out hiking, but I didn't care a whole lot about the aesthetics of the images.

<br>

I'm currently brainstorming ways to use my pictures to make a positive impact in conservation.

<br>

Apart from that, I'm a pretty avid baker of sourdough bread. And I do some bodyweight fitness to help ensure I can carry my camera around for miles and miles.
